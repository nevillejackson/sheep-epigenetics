# Sheep epigenetics #
This project is about understanding epigenetic phenomena in sheep.

## Semen quality ##
The subdirectory _semen-quality_ contains documents reporting epigenetic effects of season of joining on semen quality. These effects are passed on to the progeny. There is evidence of pre and post-natal lamb losses and wool production trait deficiences if semen is produced outside of the natural circannual breeding season.  


## What does this project hope to achieve? ##
An understanding of phenomena in sheep that are inherited but involve mechanisms outside of the normal DNA-based heredity.
