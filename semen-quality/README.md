# Semen quality #
The subdirectory _semen-quality_ contains documents reporting epigenetic effects of season of joining on semen quality. These effects are passed on to the progeny. There is evidence of pre and post-natal lamb losses and wool production trait deficiences if semen is produced outside of the natural circannual breeding season.  


## What does this project hope to achieve? ##
The semen-quality studies aim to show that there are epigenetic effects on semen produced outside the natural circannual breeding season, and that these effects are inherited and affect offspring productivity.
